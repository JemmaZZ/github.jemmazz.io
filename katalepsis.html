            “No, Raine, I have no idea what’s wrong with her,” Evelyn said. “She did all that with nothing except her own brain. Even my mother couldn’t do that. Heather, open your mouth.”

            “I left her behind.” Neither of them said anything for a long moment, but I could picture it. The shared look over my head, Evelyn’s frown, Raine’s realisation. I kept going, pouring it all out between the wracking sobs and the horrible pain in my chest. “My sister. Maisie. My twin. I left her behind in Wonderland. If she was real then I left her behind. I left my sister behind.”

            “Is that why Raine went out with you?” I asked. “The whole werewolf thing?” In the dark recesses of my mind I’d expected Twil to grin and toss her head back, like a temptress from some bad 50s noir film. Instead, she spluttered. “Eh? What? No. We never went out. What? What kinda bullshit has she been feeding you?”

            Then there was Lozzie. Of course, I didn’t know her name then, but I’d learn it soon enough.

            The girl in the goat-skull withdrew her hands from the Messenger and waved at me with the end of one sleeve. “Bye bye!” she called.

            “Yesterday, I was worried you might … think poorly of me.” I struggled to express myself. “I could barely keep up. Maisie - she reached out. Evelyn did the magic. You’re heroic-” “Heroic?” Raine broke her silence. “I’m just an overconfident dyke with a Robin Hood complex. But thanks, that’s sweet.”

            She sniffed. Her eyes were dry but rimmed with the raw red that only comes from a whole sleepless night of torment. I knew, I’d seen that look in the mirror often enough. She avoided my gaze, showed me a shoulder and shuffled notes around on the desk, just to occupy her hands. She glanced back at me, defeated and sagging. “Do your worst,” she muttered. I was completely lost. “ … excuse me?” “You’re here to yell at me, I know. Get it over with. I don’t deserve any better.”

            “Why do you think?” She set her artificial foot down with a clack. “Same reason I can’t straighten my spine. Same reason the muscles are withered in my other leg. Same reason I’m short a few fingers and hooked on painkillers. My mother did not merely teach me magic, she used me for it. I … I don’t want to talk about it. Ask Raine if you must, she knows.”

            “There’s more,” Evelyn said. She wet her lips and spoke slowly. “Malthus informs me that the being is properly named-” It was not a word. It was an un-sound that made my eyes water and my ears pop. The temperature dropped by a perceptible few degrees and a crackle passed through the air at the edge of hearing. Raine flinched and shook her head like a startled dog. Evelyn coughed and winced.

            “I’m sick of being useless! I’ve run away and hidden for ten years!” I snapped. “I’m sick of it, I’m sick of hiding! I left her behind, Raine! I’m scum. I can’t just let other people do this for me. It’s not- it’s not just about-”

            Raine’s smile turned smug and teasing. “You’re saying we both need to shower?” “Yes, yes we do.” I almost huffed. “I can think of a way to save time doing that.” My heart stopped. I swear, my heart stopped. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to slap her or let her pick me up again.
