	<h2>Entry 1</h2>
	<p>A page prompted to have the text "Dook Dookie" on it centered and displayed with 72 point font.
	<br><br>
	Result: Exactly as asked.

	<h2>Entry 2</h2>
	<p>A page prompted to have the text "Dook Dookie" on it centered and displayed with 72 point font centered on both axes. The font was to be comic sans and the background a potato tiled.
	<br><br>
	Result: As you can see the text was changed to Dookie Dookie and it was not centered vertically, but the rest is correct.

	<h2>Entry 3</h2>
	<p>A page prompted to have a text box and submit button that when pushed would open another page displaying the inputted text.
	<br><br>
	Result: Exactly as asked (although a bit boring looking).

	<h2>Entry 4</h2>
	<p>A page prompted to have a spinning photo of a potato with a configurable speed settable via a text box.
	<br><br>
	Result: The page did indeed have a text box and spinning potato, but it wasn't continuously spinning. The text box purely sets the angle the potato is rotated.
	<br><br>
	It does get points for making the page look pleasing to look at though.

	<h2>Entry 5</h2>
	<p>A page prompted to have a spinning photo of a potato with a configurable speed settable via a text box.
	<br><br>
	Result: The page did indeed have a text box and spinning potato and WAS continuously spinning. The text box does nothing.
	<br><br>
	It does get points for making the page look even more pleasing to look at though.

	<h2>Entry 6</h2>
	<p>A page prompted to have a spinning photo of a potato with a configurable speed settable via a text box.
	<br><br>
	Result: The potato spins so fast that even my 170 Hz monitor has motion blur. No text box.

	<h2>Entry 7</h2>
	<p>A page prompted to have a spinning photo of a potato with a configurable speed settable via a text box and a few other buttons.
	<br><br>
	Result: The potato can start, stop, reverse, and change speed based on user input. This required approximately 4 lines of code changes, however.

  <h2>Almost all HTML code for all web pages was generated via AI (OpenAI Playground specifically). Entry 7 specifically has minute changes because it got extremely close but not exact. All text and code on other pages was generated by the AI purely. Other than text and picture changes to this page and Entry 7, all HTML files were drag and drop.</h2>
