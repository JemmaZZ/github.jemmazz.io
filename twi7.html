            “Sand-blinded boy! I have slept with more women than you have in your life, you arrogant virgin! I have eaten the hearts of my dead foes, and watched nations fall! I am not one to be coddled or made light of! I am the Quarass of Germina!” She pointed a finger at Trey’s face. He turned crimson. “I’m not a—” Gazi looked at him. The Quarass looked at him. Trey turned pale. “I’m not! Neither is Teres! No, wait. She is. She is, I’m not!” “She’s not. You are.” “What?” “We can read your aura.” Trey went pale.

            “Brave little [Mage]. You understand what it means to fight. Not for bloodlust or victory alone. But for this. A cause.” Trey sobbed. He hugged the backpack to him. Someone had died there. A dozen! He’d killed them, and it was a mercy. “I’ll never forgive them. Never. Ever. I’ll come back and burn it to the ground.” Trey whispered it out loud. His grief was mixed with his disgust, his horror. His fury. From ahead, the Quarass looked at him, but Trey met her eyes. And it was she who looked away first.

            “You managed to come up with a workaround to the issue of mana consumption for your door after meeting a [Pirate Farmer] that your Hobgoblin ran into? Who is also coincidentally the supplier of Sage’s Grass for the entire region?” Erin paused. “You’re saying that in a strange way. Look, it’s just this one interconnected thing. Wailant’s daughter is actually Garia.” “Garia Strongheart. As in, the same Garia who I have invited to my seminar today?” “Yeah. Funny how that happens, right? So what happened was…” Grimalkin held up a claw as he massaged what would have been close to the bridge of his nose on his face. “…I will inquire later. I’m certain, no, I am sure that my decision was the correct one, Miss Solstice. You have my gratitude. Hmpf. What day is it today? I need to add another data point…”

            “You cannot stop me. I will slay you. I will slay it.” The whisper became a scream. And then—the figure moved. Shaking, blurring. The thing stabbed at Pawn, screaming. Speaking. The blade moved, stuck in the air. “I will slay ___.” It leapt back. Moved. The sword sliced through the air. Through the light. Closer. Through faith. Pawn saw it bury itself deeper in his barrier. The thing whispered. “I will slay ███.”

And then—she felt something from Klbkch. The Small Queen resolved to smack him again, and he flinched. But she reached out. And she hugged Anand.

            The Gnoll sat back in his chair and adjusted his vest. Ratici swished his long, scaly tail back and forth as he counted his fries. They were of course, men. Just a different kind of men than Human men. And they had come through a door. Pallass’ door. The Gnoll and Drake partnership was a long one, though, and soon they fell to discussing business.

            The young man from earth looked up. And his eyes were haunted. As [Soldiers] returning from war sometimes were. Those who had seen things that would stay with them forever. Fetohep froze, holding the green, misty drink in his goblet. For that was not the young man he had bade farewell to a week ago. Mortals changed too quickly. And Trey? He just smiled, as if he too were dead. And he had been buried in the ground.

            Ryoka wasn’t sure what she was seeing at first. It…looked…like a paused movie. Showing a farting Ogre bathing in swamp water. But that couldn’t be right. Ryoka felt at her neck. Hm. Heartbeat’s fine. She checked her wrist, although that was more inaccurate. Because she was convinced she was having a stroke.

            “Why do you hide your true form, girl? Alchemy-wrought it may be, but it shines truer than your false skin.” Saliss’ smile winked out. He stared at Teriarch, and the blood drained from his face. He looked around—but no one had heard. Yet the Dragon looked at him. And Saliss staggered backwards. Teriarch waited, calmly looking at him with ancient eyes. He could not know how much his words hurt. How deeply they reached and shattered something deep in Saliss’ soul. Forever changing him. Unearthing her with a single question. How much it wounded, how reassuring it was. Her true form.

            The words were spoken with such conviction that Onieva believed them. Like a light in her head that no self-doubt or lesser phrases could ever erase. No one could know—but perhaps the Dragon. He, who had seen it all. Perhaps he did know. Or it might be ignorance. But something like understanding shone in his eyes. Lacking judgment. “Why are you wearing an illusion?”

Or have you not been married yet?” For the second time Halrac spat his drink onto Typhenous. Ceria turned beet red. “What? I’m not married, Ksmvr!” The Antinium gave her a very blank look. “You are not? Are you not engaged to—aha. You are engaged to Master Hedault, your fiancé. I apologize; the nuance was lost on me.”

When did you meet him?” “During the winter.” A few of the others looked up slowly. Haley leaned forwards. “I haven’t seen ghosts. And I’ve seen a lot of weird things. But no talking paintings or ghosts. Yet. [Necromancers] are banned in Wistram, or so I hear.” “Yeah. That might be why he’s hiding. But if you meet him—you’ll know.” A few raised eyebrows. Shun raised one hand. “What’s his name?” Blackmage glanced up. He spoke the name. “Emerrhain.”

I am currently recumbent in the inn, and my breaking of the fast has been quite fine.   Ryoka fell out of her chair. Mrsha’s letter continued as the City Runner pulled herself onto the table—Alber and Fierre were staring—now in an older, posh English tone of some man in his fifties.   I have just recently been quite entertained by Numbtongue, whose musical stylings are, as ever, delightful to the ear. Lyonette does not find herself so enamored, but one supposes taste is a matter of preference…

It is still difficult to write, what with the difficulties of paws, but I know how and will continue to correspond with you as time allows. Please, continue to send more updates to The Wandering Inn, as I earnestly await your missives.   Ryoka wondered if she was having a stroke. She felt at her pulse. Nope, steady heartbeat, if elevated. The worst part—well, sort of—was that while she could see where a certain [Princess] had helped Mrsha with the flowery wording, the Gnoll had done a lot of the sentences herself. “Dead gods. Erin, you have to do something about this.” The City Runner shook her head. But the ending of the letter caught her eye.

            “Hey Wilovan, Ratici. You put those Brothers on me, right? We have to talk about that. I mean—they did the right thing—but it’s getting weird. That guy was on my butt the entire time and I never noticed! It’s a tiny bit creepy.” She pointed at the inconspicuous [Stalker], who was in fact a [Shadow] since [Stalker] was too predatory for their group.

            “I never told you, did I? My real name…” The liquid struck the ground. The Drake’s eyes opened. There he stood, as the Guild of Assassins fled his ire. Saliss of Lights. A whisper floated to Ryoka on the breeze. The Drake’s voice, borne somehow, just for her. “…I’ll tell you some other time. [Disable Friendly Fire].” Ryoka’s eyes went round. She saw the Drake wink.

My apologies to the chef. But no.” “Yes, sire.” Gamel went to dispose of the custom-made cake. Laken had forgotten. But it was today as well. Happy birthday, Erin Solstice.
