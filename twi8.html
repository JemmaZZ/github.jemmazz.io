Forgiveness without is a virtue among like-minded spirits of such nobility. Fetohep: Intriguing sentiments. What class do you possess, Mri? Mri: I have often been described as a [Druid], but my ambitions soar to [Wizard], [Adventurer] itself, and other passions. Fetohep: Ah, there is a spirit long lost.

            One day she had said her name was Zimrah. She had taken a name and identity with the butterflies, but when Pawn asked, she had told him she was actually Zimrah. It was the first time a Worker had done that, changed identities, but Pawn had thought about it and said it was obvious: You could get your name wrong. The same with everything else. Antinium were new at identity, so Zimrah was Zimrah.

            “Carrying that weapon openly is an act of aggression if not an adventurer or civilian moving about to a set purpose such as transport. Worker, you will stow that blade now.” “FuCK yOu, Klbkch.” Crusader 57 raised his middle finger instantly. Relc’s blood chilled at the sudden, familiar, warbling tones. Klbkch drew his swords so fast that Relc barely saw them. He would have diced Crusader 57—except that all of Squad 5 drew their weapons too. A friendly Crusader 53 raised a mace, and Klbkch looked at them incredulously. “What?” Relc grabbed Klbkch’s shoulder. “Easy. Easy, Klb. They’re off-duty and jumpy. I pity the [Muggers] who go after a [Soldier] on break.” Significant Beavers had moved just as fast, forming a defensive wall. Klbkch spluttered. “But that is an Aberration—how have Dekass and Tersk allowed this?” “nyEh.”

            The little girl looked like my brother. She didn’t look evil, and Doombringers were always described as evil to me. In every story. As bad as Raskghar. I wondered, then, if any stories were true. Because if she was evil, no one was good.  Maybe she was cursed. I didn’t know. But the saddest part as she watched the effigy of the Doombringer burning wasn’t that the other Gnolls were cheering. Or that none of us could say anything. The saddest part—was that she didn’t look surprised.

            The weapon was a tool of the Hunter’s Guild. It was known, colloquially, as a Bloodbeast Slayer. Why, exactly, no one could say but the oldest [Hunters] or those who recalled when it had been used. The projectiles launched from the oversized ballista looked and were always made out of wood, incidentally. They looked like giant stakes.

            They called it Norechl. God of the Forgotten. Dead God of Lost Things. It had been named before all of this, in a time when it had first arrived. Not even the others quite knew all of what Norechl was. Tamaroth. God of Rulers and Leaders. First of his pantheon, first among all. Kasigna. Three-in-One. Goddess of Death and the Afterlife. Strongest in this place. Emerrhain. God of Scholars, of Magic. And God of Secrets. A title stolen from the corpse of the last god to hold it. Laedonius Deviy. God of Dance and Love. Almost as foreign as Norechl, a traveler. Cauwine. Goddess of War, of Youth. Youngest of all and older than anything else in this world. Six dead gods. Six beings who had known death and yet refused to fully vanish. Their return had taken an aeon. They had rotted. Corpses without true form. Grasping at anything to live again.

Cease your wailing and hear me!” It was Khelta, first of all, the great [Queen of Necrocracy] that Fetohep heard, calling to the other invisible ghosts around him. Her voice was…strained. Fetohep saw her striding, gesticulating, but he did not see the other ghosts—only her. Fetohep began to speak when someone stormed towards him, through one of the walls of his palace. “Fetohep of Khelt! You must awaken Erin! You must hasten the completion of the ritual at any cost! Fetohep, the enemy has made its move, and time has run out!”

            “Sometimes the bad guys win.” Khelta looked at her—and so did Fetohep. “What, Erin Solstice?” The [Innkeeper] shrugged fractionally, chin in her hands. “I think that’s what she said. Jelaqua. She told me once—that being a Gold-rank adventurer, an adventurer, meant that you had adventures like that. Sometimes you didn’t make it out. Sometimes the good guys lost and the bad people got away. I saw it happen myself.”

            It was… A frying pan. Erin waved it around a bit—then decided to add the memory of an acid jar since she had a hand free. “Sounds good.” “Uh. Are you intending to fight the foes from beyond the end of the worst, the things that walk the world’s seam, the spawn that even those six fear and come by the endless numbers—with that?” Nerrhavia poked a finger at the frying pan. Erin hesitated. “Well, I dunno what you’ve got, but I know how to throw a frying pan. And this is acid. From acid flies. It melts people.”

            “Do you not see the end of all coming our way?” One of the ghosts demanded. Erin peered into the distance. Walls of Khelt’s palace, landmarks—it all faded away. She could see that line of abominations moving. Erin nodded and spoke quietly. “Oh yes, I see it. I’m not stupid either, no matter what you may think. I see it…and this is what I’ve got. Everyone else ready?”

            “The world ending? Not this day or any day I rule Khelt. I am Fetohep, 19th Ruler of Eternal Khelt! Eternal Khelt. I did not inherit this glorious throne and millenia of effort to watch it end today. Let the world try to end. When the sea rises, I will order it to turn back on itself. When the mountains crumble, I will build them anew in gold and jewels.” “Ooh.” Erin Solstice saw him whirl. He pointed at the eighteen rulers. “Fight like you are the meanest warriors of Khelt and speak not of defeat to me. I will return Erin Solstice’s body no matter who has stolen it. Erin Solstice?” He looked at her, and she jumped. “Yes, Fetohep, sir?” “Leave the living world to me. Go. Do not let yourself perish. Leave your friends and family to me. I will deal with this petty civil war between Gnolls and the idiocy of Drakes.”

            Something Alked noted in that shocked moment was how good Fetohep’s form was. He ran like the warrior he’d been, back straight, arms and legs pumping. Not lazily or in some pretentious way, with his arms spread behind him in a ‘v’ shape like some [Assassins]. He just booked it. At the speed of one of the greatest warriors of his era. Maybe with magic too. Everyone was silent as the ruler of Khelt passed by. Frieke looked at Alked, and he nodded. Yep. I just saw that too.

            The King of Khelt was already three streets down by the time Alked began to give chase. His citizens turned and saw the blur race past them. At first, they wondered if they were seeing this or had heatstroke. Then they began to panic. Fetohep of Khelt never ran. Never. He had moved swiftly at times, to stop an imminent accident in his presence. On the battlefield, he galloped and fought swiftly on foot— Yet a King did not run.

            A few citizens were walking in a group, fearless of wagons, which were a rare sight in—Fetohep dodged around them and saw them whirl and drop their gelato cones. He nearly ran into a little girl crossing the street and, rather than knock her flat, picked her up. For eight steps, the girl of about eight and Fetohep stared at each other—then he deposited her next to her mother. The Revenant never broke from the dead run. “—jesty! Your—”

            “Tell me one thing, Erin Solstice. Does it make your life better, having Skills or classes? Your world has neither. If you could go back home with them—would you?” It was a strange question, but Erin answered automatically. “I—yeah? It makes things so much easier. It’s so cool. It’s amazing. It…it might make things too easy, y’know, and it can do bad things too.” She hesitated, catching herself, and the Gnome’s gray eyes fixed on her searchingly. Erin bit her lip. “…But it makes everything magical. Especially the actual magic. Earth needs more of that. The good stuff, not the bad. I don’t know about everyone getting Skills—but I’d like to keep them.” She didn’t know if that was a bad answer. A few Gnomes in earshot looked at her, and one hmmed, but Zineryr just patted her hand. “That’s a wonderfully fair answer. I would that Sprigaena could hear it. Her and all the others. It lacks context, but it makes me glad. I will admit—it certainly makes things easier. Something to bear in mind.”

The great Devourer of Time was halted in midair. Xarkouth kept beating his wings, but the Void Dragon realized—he wasn’t going anywhere. Everyone was fighting below—Erin saw magic bloom across a Seamwalker who looked up at her…but it seemed like an eternity for the magic to lash its body. The world froze a second. The Gnomes looked at each other, then burst into merry laughter. “What a completely ridiculous ability! And how fortunate!”

And then Erin saw a sight she never wanted to see. The Gnomes wept. Tears ran from their eyes as the old ghosts cried. One tore at her hair, and Zineryr covered his face. “Is this one last spiteful act of gods? We saw them not, and I only believed they were excluded from this place or sent elsewhere. Monsters?

            “I have so many more questions! What about Antinium?” Four Gnomes crowded around her, then three. Zineryr sighed, scratching at his hair. “I have never met them. Some ghosts whispered of new species—but they can appear organically. Ant-people? Good for them. We had spider-folk, once. Remember they are people.”

            “The Goblinfriend of Izril!” Erin Solstice froze. “W-what did you just say?” Zineryr’s finger wavered. The Gnome fixed on Nereshal as the [Chronomancer] babbled. “You’re too young! And you and I have met—you don’t remember?” “No. Who are…?” Erin was sure she’d remember this guy. Had she tossed the memory at the dead gods? No—Nereshal had a sudden, desperate look on his face. “Then I died after whenever this is! Time! Time can be changed. Please! You must listen! The Blighted King will go mad! I will be slain when I oppose him! Stop him! Warn me!” “Hey—hey—I don’t know what…” Erin’s mouth was dry. Wait. Was this really what she suspected? A time paradox? Why not? With the Timewalker…the man was holding her.

Empress Nsiia does not speak fondly of you.” Flos did a double-take as Gazi regarded Ksmvr with clear confusion. “Is this Klbkch the Slayer? No—Ksmv…Ksmvr? Of Chandrar! Aha! The one who knows the Loquea Dree and helped free Sottheim? And Nsiia? You, my friend, I owe a boon to!” Then Flos grabbed Ksmvr and lifted him up in a hug.

A magic innkeeper, though.” “An [Innkeeper].” The First King of Avel’s face was completely blank, but Marquin just laughed, throwing her head back. “Now there is a story. An [Innkeeper] who defies those six?” She turned to Xarkouth, and he rumbled. “It seems she has managed to make dread enemies of at least three. The faceless one, the bearded one, and the three-in-one all hate her with a passion.”

Ryoka Griffin screamed as the spell activated. It was a beautiful piece of magic. Regardless of body. It cared nothing for distance or time. Only that the soul was there. It asked for only one thing, and the knowledge screamed in Ryoka. Who? She just had to give it a name. An identity. So Ryoka did. She cried out. She screamed the words. “Teriarch!

It was a promise, a return. Thump. Thump. Thump… In time, he opened his eyes and saw her looking up at him. The Dragonlord of Flame woke up and knew it was time. Time for the [Innkeeper] whom ghosts spoke of. A debt owed. Another moment of defiance. Teriarch spread his wings and flew.

            His head jerked around, and a bruise slapped itself across his face. That slap hurt more than pouring Firebreath whiskey in a stab wound. He staggered, and Nerrhavia’s slap knocked him back a step. In Zeres, the City of Waves, a Drake mother went sprawling across her house. A second Drake, her husband, slammed down the steps as a hand cracked him across the face. Two of Femar’s siblings went down, shrieking. The Tyrant of Sands lowered her hand as she hit Femar’s entire family line. She was the greatest tyrant of her age. She pointed down at Femar as he rose.
