Ebi was by her side, soothing and seemingly applying some kind of analgesic. Opal held her right hand, her flesh one, but I could still see how the taller woman was trembling. She took a few deep breaths and seemed to steady herself, then her eyes flicked to me. Or rather, her eye did. Her left eye was whole, a vivid green on par with Hina’s blue that made me entertain the idea that she should have been Emerald. After a moment, the patch covering her right lit up. It was a digital screen like Ebi’s face, and the projected ‘eye’ moved in sync with her physical one. It wasn’t quite seamless and didn’t sell the illusion of being the real thing, the way a sufficiently intricate LM construct might, but I was sure she owned fancier ones for outside the comfort of her home—since like Hina’s teeth or the bags under Ai’s eyes, my memory of Amane’s face was unblemished in videos and even live streams, sanitized of her mortality.</pre><pre class="diff-removed">-In person, her pain was apparent. Even through whatever painkillers Ebi had applied, her jaw was clenched and her shoulders were hunched, visible through the well-practiced smile of greeting she turned on me. It made my heart hurt, remembering the moments of agony earlier in the day when I had woken up from my nap and when entering and exiting the spell circle, and the longer months of recovery from the first time everything had changed for me, seven years prior. Even if I were to include my hand’s burns, my blood prices paled in comparison to what I knew of her injuries—not that I could see most of it here due to the baggy hoodie she wore and her legs being hidden under the table. The only sign other than the eye was her free hand emerging from the sleeve, an intricate white-and-purple construct that moved like flesh, holding the spoon. Ai’s masterwork, self-animated by Amane’s own lattice. The resemblances to Ebi’s own chassis were obvious, but this looked even more high-tech.</pre><pre class="diff-added">+Until she dropped her mantle. The crystalline, faceted forms of the mecha folded in on themselves, sort of rotating like Ebi’s hand had earlier, and the air hissed as it rushed to fill the now-vacant space. Then there was a whump as Amethyst’s true body popped out of wherever it had been…stored, presumably. The actual mechanism was a well-kept secret, though I had my suspicions and educated guesses.</pre><pre class="diff-added">+Amane Ishikawa’s hair was brown, although darker than the borderline-red of Hina’s, and fell in a straight, well-maintained curtain all around her head. Star had once explained that it was something of a point of pride for her, described in interviews as a reminder that she was still a magical girl, for all the time she spent with a construct for a body. She wasn’t nearly as tall as her mantled form, of course, but she was still the tallest Radiance by a noticeable margin—although that wasn’t saying much, as the team as a whole skewed short; I still had an inch on her. She was wearing earrings, something pale that might have been pearl—or opal. Freckles were splattered across her face, interrupted on her right side by faint crisscrossed scars coming up from her cheek, some wrapping around to her temple where others disappeared under the eyepatch covering that side.</pre><pre class="diff-added">+The first thing she did was emit a choking gasp, achingly familiar. Ebi was by her side, soothing and seemingly applying some kind of analgesic. Opal held her right hand, her flesh one, but I could still see how the taller woman was trembling.

No, since she was clearly in pain—yes, because it was familiar pain, a simple fact of her life for years now. Ebi glared at me a little, but the way Opal’s eyes flicked to me without reprimand suggested that the empathy was what counted. Amane herself nodded and gave me a thumbs-up with the prosthetic hand—some things transcended language—squeezed her eyes shut, and took a deep breath. Then she reopened her eyes and began to eat. Ebi left her side after a moment, but Opal kept holding her other hand, the flesh one, as they ate. I got the sense that this was something of a ritual for the three, or perhaps the team as a whole. My phone buzzed.</pre><pre class="diff-context"> ebi-furai: amethyst can take care of herself</pre><pre class="diff-context"> ebi-furai: be respectful, shes not made of glass</pre><pre class="diff-context"> ezzen: gotcha, sorry</pre><pre class="diff-removed">-I understood; I figured Opal holding her hand was an exception. I looked down at my right hand under the table, examining the familiar patchwork of scarring, moving the fingers. I had mostly full mobility, since they had spared no expense in the wake of such a horrible and tragic disaster, an entire year of skin grafts and cutting-edge treatments aided by magic still in its infancy. “Nobody should have to go through that, what a nightmare, how was I holding up”—I had long since become inured to the well-wishes. Sometimes, horrible things just happen, and the scars aren’t symbols of bravery or valor, just pain.</pre><pre class="diff-added">+I understood; I figured Opal holding her hand was an exception.

There was only one thing that readily came to mind, the only thing I was really good at. I stood, returning to the whiteboard. Amethyst had drawn out a decent portion of her mantle’s lattice for me, although much of it was shorthand and getting all the details would need me to actually boot up the program on my laptop to properly keep track of everything. But this was my comfort zone, my one real talent, and so I had been able to tabulate ripple values on-the-fly with formulas I knew by heart as we sketched different configurations. I picked up a smaller whiteboard leaning against the main one’s ledge. I could tell there was a lattice in it, and just from feel and context—</pre><pre class="diff-context"> “This what I think it is?”</pre><pre class="diff-context"> “Yes, just tug.”</pre><pre class="diff-context"> I did—magically, not physically—and the larger board’s contents copied themselves onto the smaller one. I brought it over, putting it between us on the table. I began to draw in a new chunk, {ICE}-{TRANSPOSE}, linked in orange to the main {MANIFEST} chunk, on the high-pulse side. I drew in a little stick figure version of Amethyst and circled the legs, then put a big question mark next to it. My gut was telling me the resemblance to the Spire’s skin was more than superficial.</pre><pre class="diff-removed">-Opal caught my eye as I passed the marker to Amane, and nodded. I took that as a sign that this was the right way to treat her, based on what Ebi had said. Amane’s good arm—the mechanical one–-grabbed the marker, and she gave my addition a once-over, before going over my question mark with a check mark, confirming my guess. It didn’t tremble the way her flesh-arm did. Then she wrote something in kanji next to it, reading the label aloud.</pre><pre class="diff-added">+Opal caught my eye as I passed the marker to Amane, and nodded.

I nodded and shoveled some more curry into my mouth, having made the executive decision to forego my chopsticks for the spoon.
