<BR/>
<BR/><b>Prologue:</b>
<BR/>"Who, I wonder?"
<BR/>I sang "Evening lit by the moonlight"
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Day 1:</b>
<BR/>Try leaving through the main entrance
<BR/>Can handle them
<BR/>Ask indirectly
<BR/>Don't say anything
<BR/>Talk to the man
<BR/>Where are we?
<BR/>His words bothered me
<BR/>Talk to Yuni
<BR/>I won't eat it after all
<BR/>Try getting angry
<BR/>Take them
<BR/>Press her harder about her relationship with Satoru
<BR/>Chuuka-don (Chinese-style rice bowl)
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Day 2:</b>
<BR/>Hold it in
<BR/>Mentally prepare and go
<BR/>Draw a snowman
<BR/>Just keep quiet
<BR/>Pineapple-flavored
<BR/>Is Yuni a clone?
<BR/>Yuni's room!
<BR/>Warn Mayuzumi
<BR/>It wouldn't have been like you not to save her, Yomogi-san
<BR/>Run to a private room
<BR/>Look for a footstool
<BR/>Let them see more
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Day 3:</b>
<BR/>Ignore Mayuzumi
<BR/>Go back
<BR/>Stay silent
<BR/>Duck to avoid it
<BR/>Tell him to try reading Mayuzumi's palm
<BR/>I'll stay silent and listen carefully
<BR/>Don't review it
<BR/>Give an evasive answer
<BR/>Lend Yomogi a hand
<BR/>I'll fix it
<BR/>Say that it's okay like this
<BR/>Wait here
<BR/>I didn't eat
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Day 4:</b>
<BR/>Mayuzumi's argument has its good points as well
<BR/>want to leave it to Mayuzumi
<BR/>Ask Yuni why he'd run away
<BR/>Leave the food to Yomogi
<BR/>For now, walk away from the building
<BR/>Stop
<BR/>Advance along the wall to the left side
<BR/>Keep on watching
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Day 5:</b>
<BR/>Looked out the window
<BR/>Go get it
<BR/>Call Yuni over
<BR/>Eat the food
<BR/>Stay still
<BR/>Save Yuni
<BR/>Continue watching
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Day 6:</b>
<BR/>[no choices]
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Day 7:</b>
<BR/>Could there be relief supplies at Location X?
<BR/>Keep going
<BR/>Turn back
<BR/>
<BR/>

<font size="+1">II. Satoru Good End/Epilogue</font>
<BR/>
<BR/>Note that to reach this ending, you must continue directly off a system data save of Kokoro's good ending. This means you should complete Kokoro's good ending, save the system data, and then immediately start a new Satoru game. Do that and follow these choices to reach the good ending.
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Prologue:</b>
<BR/>"Who, I wonder?"
<BR/>I didn't sing it as a child
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Day 1:</b>
<BR/>"It's been a while..."
<BR/>Have we ever met before?
<BR/>Go take a look at my own appearance
<BR/>just came to help
<BR/>Deny it
<BR/>sound familiar
<BR/>What caused my DID?
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Day 2:</b>
<BR/>Examine the bed
<BR/>Examine the desk/refrigerator/shelves (any order; you'll do them all, so it doesn't matter which you choose, but CHOOSE THE BED FIRST or you won't be able to get the good end. I'm serious.)
<BR/>Answer "Good morning
<BR/>Breakfast-style
<BR/>Have some
<BR/>Put some in
<BR/>I climbed it
<BR/>Don't turn around
<BR/>Don't turn around
<BR/>Answer
<BR/>Go to Inubushi's room (you can go to Yuni's first if you want)
<BR/>Inubushi Keiko, right?
<BR/>No
<BR/>Consent
<BR/>Because I saw someone that looked just like you a year ago
<BR/>Ask him whether he rememnbers the names Yomogi and Lin
<BR/>Run away
<BR/>I wouldn't believe the article
<BR/>"I can't do that."
<BR/>Speak kind words
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Day 3:</b>
<BR/>Snowboarding
<BR/>(Make whichever choices in the basketball game you want)
<BR/>That's not the problem, okay?
<BR/>I wouldn't
<BR/>I can
<BR/>Were you the one who made the rat sick?
<BR/>...ask if there was something wrong with Kokoro
<BR/>I want you to think about what the meaning is of you being alive
<BR/>Are you hiding something?
<BR/>approached Hotori
<BR/>don't know it
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Day 4:</b>
<BR/>Answer "I came to watch over you"
<BR/>Refuse
<BR/>...Yomogi-san, don't you?
<BR/>I haven't.
<BR/>Drink
<BR/>
<BR/><b>Day 5:</b>
<BR/>Why would I want to kill you?
<BR/>No
<BR/>Call out to her
